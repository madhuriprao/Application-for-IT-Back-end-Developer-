              <p class="firstanswer">
                Last year, I decided to pursue a career change from Project Management to IT. 
                I started self-studying through YouTube videos and short online courses. 
                It was during this exploration that I discovered Sundsgarder IT for Women.
                I was immediately drawn to the program and applied.
                The five months I spent in the program provided a solid foundation in web development. Not only did I gain technical skills, but I also discovered a deep enjoyment in the field. This newfound passion motivates me to pursue back-end development and set my path towards becoming a full-stack developer.

            <h2 class="secondquestion">Why You'd Be a Good Developer?</h2>
            <p class="secondanswer">
              I love turning designs into real things that work.
               During my front-end studies, I built a working game and some cool websites and it was so satisfying see them come to live. It's more than just the technical knowledge; it's the genuine joy I find in the creative problem-solving process of coding.
This enthusiasm, combined with my strong work ethic and dedication to learning, makes me a strong candidate.

            <p class="thirdanswer">
               I'm  <strong>Madhuri!</strong> I recently moved to Sweden after working as a project coordinator for a media company (like Netflix) for almost five years.
                Back in India, I got my engineering degree, but in a field far different from computers. 
                There was always a part of me that wanted to learn more about computer science. 
                Fast forward to my move to Sweden last year to be with my partner,
                it felt like a perfect time to finally start fresh and give my IT dreams a shot.
                I started learning HTML and CSS on my own, and it was very interesting that I wanted to learn even more. 
                Now, I'm interested in becoming a full-stack developer, which means working on both the "front-end" and the "back-end" . 
                For the past five months, I've been taking a course called "IT for Women" at Sundsgarden. I learned HTML, CSS, 
                JavaScript, React, and some Bootstrap. 
                It wasn't just about the skills, though - I also met a bunch of other women who are passionate about tech, which has been great!
                Now that I've gotten a good foundation in front-end development, I'm excited to learn back-end too. 
                I think it will make me a well-rounded full-stack developer. </p>

        <p class="fourthanswer">
            During my five months at Sundsgarden, I participated in the "IT for Women" course which introduced me to various front-end technologies. The curriculum covered:
        </p>

    <li>HTML: Building the core structure of web pages.</li>
    <li>CSS: Styling web pages with layouts, colors, and fonts.
    </li>
    <li>JavaScript: Adding interactivity and functionality to web pages.
    </li>
    <li>React: Building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.
    </li>
    <li>Bootstrap (Basics): Applying a popular framework for faster and more consistent web development.</li>
</br>
  As part of the course, I collaborated with classmates on building a functional game, showcasing our understanding of these language

    <h2 class="fifthquestion">GitHub Project and Explanation.</h2>
    <p class="fifthanswer">
        This <a href="https://github.com/madhuriprao/Task-manager" target="_blank">link</a> showcases my task manager project.</a>
       
        This is one of my favorite projects from the "IT for Women" course. We used JavaScript to manage tasks within a user interface (although currently, the interface is created using pop-up alerts). 
    
        Here's a breakdown of the key functionalities: 

            <li>        Task Addition: Prompts the user for a task description, assigns a unique ID, and displays a success message.
        </li>
       <li>       Task Listing: Allows users to view all tasks, including their IDs, descriptions, and completion status.
    </li> 
<li>        Task Completion: Enables users to mark tasks as complete by entering the task ID.
</li>
<li>        Completed Task Listing: Provides a filtered view of only completed tasks.
</li> 
        <br>
        While the project utilizes pop-up alerts for user interaction, it shows my understanding of  JavaScript concepts like functions, arrays, conditional statements, and loops. It also highlights my ability to create a functional application with user input and task management capabilities.
